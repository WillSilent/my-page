I am an associate professor at SMU Lyle. I lead the Mobile and Internet SecuriTy Lab (MIST LAB). My research interests include Cyber Security and Privacy, Robotics Security, Sensing, Smart Health Care, Mixed Reality, Internet of Things, and Machine Learning.

 

Chen Wang received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University and he worked at WINLAB. He obtained his Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from University of Electronic and Science of Technology of China (UESTC). [Google Scholar]

I am seeking collaborations with small businesses and startups in the areas of security, smart health, robotics, blockchain-based technologies and the metaverse!

  Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

  Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

  Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
